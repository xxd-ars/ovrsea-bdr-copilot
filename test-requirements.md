# Junior GenAI Engineer: Technical Test

## **🎯 Objective**

Your goal is to help our BDRs (Sales Reps) to automate some of their daily tasks. For this you will prepare a simple web application and integrate agentic capabilities in it during the interview. A BDR in our company needs to prepare potential clients ("leads") by being well informed about them, contact them regularly and try to convince them from our services.

*NB: This project is already in production at Ovrsea. We're not asking you to do our work for us, of course.*

## **📋 How to prepare for the Tech Interview**

### Task 1: Create a list of 10 leads for OVRSEA
1. Choose 5 characteristics (like location, size, product etc)
2. Save the data in a table or other storage format that can easily be enhanced/changed during the interview

*Important: You need to choose real companies with their real characteristics*

### Task 2: Setup a simple web app
1. The user has an overview of all leads with the most important information
2. Each lead can be clicked-on to show a more detailed view
3. The user can add leads and can add information to leads

*Important: Keep it very light-weight, we don't expect a full-stack app here*

### Task 3: Prepare for agentic capabilities
1. Have a general LLM-API available (openAI, Gemini or others)
2. Have a framework and/or helper functions ready that support you to build the agent (or agentic workflow) during the interview

## **🚀 During the interview**

> 🔎 In this interview, we'll tackle 1 or 2 specific tasks of a BDR at our company. We want to see how you use GenAI to automate those processes end-to-end. We value **utility and speed** - think of it as building a 'productivity hack' that works today, not an academic experiment.

## **✅ Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Real-Life Impact** - how valuable your solution would be in a real-world environment.
2. **Capability** of the agentic setup.
3. **Creativity** in using AI/ML techniques.
4. **Code Quality** - produce good and readable code.

## **📥 Before the Interview**

- **Try not to spend more than 3-4 hours on the preparation.**
- Provide a link to a Git repository with the code.
- Make sure, that you can share your screen with us.
- Be ready at the start of the interview to explain very briefly what you did and to continue working in your IDE on your solution [based on the requirements during the interview].

## 🪵 Resources

- You're free to use **any tool, framework and language** you like.
- You can also request API keys for any service you find relevant.
- **Usage of AI for coding before and during the interview is highly encouraged.**
